Python-Rest-Client
==================

A python base drest client to fetch-update-post data and in most cases with a simple command.

Currently handles only HTTP Basic authorization. Does not handle OAuth currently.

Also, one can model it to code their own client. In its current state and also the intention was not to make it generic.
